Underwater Image Dehazing
Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the visibility of underwater images by applying dehazing techniques. Underwater images often suffer from low contrast and color distortion due to scattering and absorption of light. The goal of this project is to improve image clarity, making it easier to analyze underwater objects and features.

Features
Dehazing algorithms: Implemented techniques to reduce haze and improve image visibility.
Image Processing: Uses color correction and contrast enhancement techniques to restore color balance.
Support for Custom Images: You can upload your own underwater images to apply the dehazing algorithm.
Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries installed. Follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/THULASISANDEEP/underwater-image-dehazing.git
Change to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd underwater-image-dehazing
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To dehaze an image:

Place your image in the input directory.
Run the main script:
bash
Copy code
python dehaze.py --input input/your_image.jpg --output output/your_image_dehazed.jpg
The processed image will be saved in the output directory.
Folder Structure
input: Contains original underwater images.
output: Contains dehazed images generated by the algorithm.
src: Core scripts for the dehazing process.
Dependencies
